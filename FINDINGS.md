# Findings

One line per surprise, written the day it happened. Undocumented experiments are worthless.

## Day 1 — Tue 8 Sep (started 7 Sep)

- **Port 5432 was already taken by a native PostgreSQL service.** Docker reported the port
  published (`5432/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:5432`) and the container was healthy, yet host clients got
  `FATAL: password authentication failed for user "orders"` — because they were reaching the
  *native* server, which has no such user. In-container `psql` worked fine, which is the
  signal that the problem is the host port, not the database. Moved to host port 5433.
- **Compose shell-splits a plain-string `command`.** With `entrypoint: ["/bin/sh","-c"]`, a
  string `command:` is tokenised, so `sh -c` received only the first word and `kafka-topics.sh`
  ran with no arguments and printed its help text. Fix: pass the command as a **single-element
  list** so it survives as one argv entry.
- Kafka warns that topic names mixing `.` and `_` can collide in metric names. `orders.dlq`
  is fine on its own; just don't also introduce `orders_dlq`.
